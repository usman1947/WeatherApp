## Description
I did this project for my first job interview in september 2021, if you want to see what my code looked like at that time you can go to this link, its of my first commit of when I pushed long lost files back to github to redo this project. After a year working as a FullStack dev i thought it would be a good idea to go back to this project, refactor it, make it responsive and in the meantime see how much have I improved.
